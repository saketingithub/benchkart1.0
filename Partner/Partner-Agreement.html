The amount of Registration Fees payable may be fixed or may vary depending upon the plans that may be introduced by the Company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the event the Client is not satisfied with your Service as the same was unsatisfactory, deficient, incomplete or the Project was delayed due to your negligence then the Company has the discretion to cancel your account and/or refund the Consideration amount to the Client and levy a penalty upon you for loss of business which shall not be less than the Commission that the Company would have secured on successful completion of the Project.</p>
