                        <h3>A growing wellness company now just can’t do without Benchkart!</h3>
                        <p class="font-italic">
                            Prior to their Series A funding in 2019, the client had already been seeing good traction in the market. Now, with increasing team size and rapidly growing operations, they needed SPEED. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our relationship started when they were looking to automate their MIS Dashboards. They didn’t want to go for expensive packaged solutions, but wanted someone to work on their existing database and create automated dashboards – where the team members could find reports basis their roles. This project was eventually bagged by an Agency in Gujarat, one of the most reputed B2B Digital Services agencies in India. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the 1st Project was still underway, they posted another project - for hiring of 3 Software Developers within for a period of 6 months. They wanted to infuse short-term talent without creating a permanent position within their organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the time of writing, the client has already posted 7 projects within 3 months. They say “It’s like having your own team of 500 agencies, that you can reach at the click of a mouse”</p>

                        <p class="font-italic">
                            The lock-down period led them to re-evaluate their existing agencies. As lock-downs eased & business started gradually to get back into shape, it was clear to them that their Social Media Agency needed to be changed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Their brief for the replacement search to us was very clear. The new agency had to have a good combination of creative as well as execution skills on social media platforms, primarily FB, Insta & You-tube. Secondly, they wanted an agency from the same city as they preferred face-to-face meetings. Lastly, they were not necessarily looking for an agency with real estate experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Digital Team spent a lot of time with the client in understanding the existing challenges and the context under which the change was being looked at. We detailed out the project brief document itself for our partner agencies, conducted numerous interviews with short-listed agencies and then eventually took our shortlist to the client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Digital Marketing team & Relationship Manager coordinated with all the agencies as the internal processes for Agency on-boarding were happening at the client’s end. The agency eventually finalized had a big surprise in store for them, as they actually got a much bigger mandate than what the project started out as!

                        <h3>An Oil & Gas company from Saudi Arabia gets ERP Implemented</h3>
                        <p class="font-italic">A deal with an Oil & Gas major, meant that our client’s operations would have to scale up. They had to replace their legacy application with a packaged ERP solution. The lack of quality IT service providers in KSA meant that they were not advised adequately about which ERP to go with as well as what should be the phase wise implementation plan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Our involvement was right from the stage of defining their project brief, providing them multiple options – including SAP B1, Microsoft Dynamics as well as custom ERP solutions, doing research on what would work in their unique work environment (Oilfield Equipment manufacture & services), organizing pitch presentations as well as helping in finalizing the contract & resourcing terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           We are now exploring a unique partnership for KSA markets with this company, where we acn jointly provide Indian IT support to clients in their country!

                        <h3>A Marketing Agency migrates to the cloud</h3>
                        <p class="font-italic">
                           With Operations expanding across Delhi, Mumbai & Bangalore; our client could no longer keep spending on capex in infrastructure. The largest issues for them were large files (Photoshop, CorelDRAW) which were filling up their mailboxes as well as PCs. They also wanted to migrate to a cloud environment to run some of the software from the cloud as well adopt a productivity platform for all their needs. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Our agencies asked a lot of questions in this particular case about their infrastructure, space required per user, type of tech environment including software etc, before recommending great plan for licensing of applications as well as movement to cloud on a subscription basis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite not having any IT team, our client was able to learn a lot during this process of multiple proposals as well as discussions with Benchkart team. This was a key factor in their eventually selecting the best value for them and get a smooth migration to the cloud.

                        <h3>Start-ups & Small Businesses leverage Agency experience for their Web & App Projects</h3>
                        <p class="font-italic">Not all projects have been large or long duration. The greatest satisfaction we have got has been in working with start-ups & small businesses. A large no of these projects have been in Graphics (e.g. making pitch presentations), Websites (Basic websites to large e-commerce portals) & Apps (Android & iOS applications).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Whether Social Media Marketing project for an ‘after smoke’ air freshener, developing contactless dining mobile application for a restaurant, or modernizing the website for a hyperlocal grocery home-delivery business, the scope of projects has been varied. We have also been able to onboard agencies in case we are missing some capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           In many cases, clients had earlier worked with a freelancer or lesser known agency and had not got the best results. This put additional pressure on us to ensure that the client should not lose any more time, now that they had approached Benchkart.

                            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><b>Invest</b>: If your business is not negatively impacted by the lockdown, this is a good time to invest into marketing & set the business up for future. Take advantage of the downturn to get good deals on your IT infrastructure upgradation, process outsourcing or cloud migration. Industries like ed-tech, specific players in pharma & health, business consulting and e-retailing are investing a lot right now.</li>
                            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><b>Pilot</b>: On the other extreme, industries like travel & tourism, bars & restaurants, sports & fitness have both a short term & long-term challenge, unless they try new approaches. They also should not spend excessively on these new approaches. Quick small-scale pilot projects are an effective way to test new ideas. Finding reliable partners in this journey is key to long term success.</li>
                            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><b>Digitize</b>: Industries like Retail, esp. of essential goods, had minimal impact in the short term, but are likely to be impacted by increase in e-commerce in the longer term. Business owners here need to look at improving online presence, increasing digital marketing and adding services like home delivery and digital payments.</li>
                            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><b>Conserve</b>:  Some businesses, esp. Start-ups were impacted more due to the challenges with finding talent & capital. Re-directing the spends from full time employees into out-sourcing, from office spaces to work from home, and from traditional media to social media are some of the ways they are smartening up in the short run to keep the dreams for a great future alive.</li>
